# Introduction
ServiceNow is a platform that provides enterprise-level services for various organizational functions, including IT, customer service, HR, and security operations. The platform is designed to streamline business processes and provide a unified view of organizational data to improve efficiency and decision-making. One of the key features of the ServiceNow platform is its database view, which provides a graphical representation of data stored in the platform's database.

In this article, we will provide an in-depth look at the ServiceNow database view, including its benefits, how it works, and best practices for using it effectively.

## Benefits of Database View in ServiceNow

The ServiceNow database view provides several benefits for organizations, including:

Improved Data Visibility: The database view provides a graphical representation of data stored in the ServiceNow database, making it easier for users to visualize and understand complex relationships between data sets.

Simplified Reporting: The database view allows users to create custom reports and dashboards based on the data stored in the ServiceNow database. This makes it easier for organizations to generate meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.

Enhanced Collaboration: The database view allows multiple users to view and edit data simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and improving communication between teams.

Improved Efficiency: The database view enables users to quickly search for and retrieve specific data sets, reducing the time required to complete tasks and improving overall efficiency.

## How Database View Works in ServiceNow

The ServiceNow database view is a graphical representation of data stored in the platform's database. It provides a visual representation of tables, columns, and relationships between data sets. Users can customize the view to display specific data sets, filter data, and create custom reports and dashboards.

The database view consists of two main components: the Table Map and the Related Lists.

## Table Map

The Table Map is a graphical representation of tables and relationships between data sets. It displays tables as boxes and columns as fields within those boxes. Users can click on a box to view details about the table and its columns.

The Table Map also displays relationships between data sets as lines connecting boxes. These relationships are based on foreign keys, which are fields that reference data in other tables. For example, if one table contains information about employees and another table contains information about departments, the two tables can be linked using a foreign key.

## Related Lists

Related Lists display data from related tables. Users can customize Related Lists to display specific data sets and columns. Related Lists can also be used to create custom reports and dashboards.

## Best Practices for Using Database View in ServiceNow

To get the most out of the ServiceNow database view, it is important to follow best practices for using the feature. These best practices include:

Understand Your Data: Before using the database view, it is important to have a good understanding of the data stored in the ServiceNow database. This includes understanding the relationships between tables and columns and how data is organized.

Keep It Simple: The database view can quickly become complex and overwhelming if too much information is displayed. To avoid this, keep the view simple and only display the data sets and columns that are necessary.

Use Filters: Filters can be used to limit the data displayed in the database view. This can help users find specific data sets and columns more quickly and improve overall efficiency.

Customize Related Lists: Related Lists can be customized to display specific data sets and columns. This can help users create custom reports and dashboards that are tailored to their specific needs.

Train Users: To ensure that users are able to use the database view effectively, it is important to provide training and support. This can include providing documentation, training videos, and other resources to help users get the most out of the feature.
