## Adding Words

You need to write a function that takes multiple words as its argument and returns a concatenated version of those words separated by dashes (-).
The function should be able to take a varying number of words as the argument.

### Sample input
this
is
great

### Sample Output
this-is-great
Recall, using 

```python title="addWords.py"

def concatenate(*args):
    print('-'.join(args))
    

print(concatenate("I", "love", "Python", "!"))
```
