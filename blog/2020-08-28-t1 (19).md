Write a VB program to enter two positive numbers, calculate the sum of the products of each pair of digits occupying the same position in the two numbers. Display the result on to the form. Example: If first number is 45 and second number is 534, then output will be 32. (0\*5 + 4\*3 + 5*4 = 32) 


```vb title="file.vb"
  
Private Sub Command1_Click()  
	Dim no1 As Integer  
	Dim no2 As Integer  
	Dim r1 As Integer, r2 As Integer, sum As Integer  
		no1 = Val(Text1.Text)  
  
  
	no2 = Val(Text2.Text)  
	While no1 Or no2  
		r1 = no1 Mod 10  
		r2 = no2 Mod 10  
		prod = r1 * r2  
		sum = sum + prod  
		no1 = no1  10  
		no2 = no2  10  
	Wend  
	Print "Sum of Product is "; sum  
	  
End Sub
