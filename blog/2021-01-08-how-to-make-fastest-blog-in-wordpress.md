Let's remove non-required things, please [watch Video Guide](https://blog.kaustubh.codes/wp-admin/post.php?post=1185&action=edit#video-guide).

## Removing Non-Required Things

We will remove all the Non-required Plugins, Posts, Pages, Themes that are previously installed , move to trash and delete from that trash too. please [watch Video Guide](https://blog.kaustubh.codes/wp-admin/post.php?post=1185&action=edit#video-guide).

## Installing Theme

We will install [GeneratePress](https://wordpress.org/themes/generatepress/) theme here, Currently this is fastest theme available. Open **WordPress Dashboard**, -> **Appearance** -> **Themes** and in searchbox type **GeneratePress** and Click **install** then **Activate**.
![How To Make Fastest Blog in WordPress](http://blog.kaustubh.codes/imgs/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-22.png) 

you just installed and activated theme. You can use this theme completely **FREE**. But we want some features that are NOT available in FREE version, So we're buying Premium here, If you don't want to invest money now, simply use this theme, But if you can , I will definitely suggest to go for Pro version.

## Installing & Activating Pro

You can visit generatepress.com/premium to purchase pro. It will cost you around $49 for year. We know it's big amount but it's okay for this theme. If you want to purchase GPL Version of this theme, Please Click on Link Below.



[Get GPL GeneratePress](https://blog.kaustubh.codes/product/gpl-generatepress/)





_[ **NOTE** : GPL is GNU general public license and its legal to use. Read more about [GPL here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) ]_

Now we assume that you have GeneratePress copy. Now Open **Plugins** , Click on **Add New** then **Upload plugin**, and upload the file we just purchased.
