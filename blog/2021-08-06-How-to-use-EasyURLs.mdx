## Installation
### Uploading Files

To upload files, first we need to download them from [EasyURLs repository](https://github.com/kaustubhk24/EasyURLs/)

[Download zip file](https://github.com/kaustubhk24/EasyURLs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Once source code is downloaded. Now visit your website's CPanel. You can access your cpanel from your hosting provider's site or you can directly access using cpanel.yoursite.com or yoursite.com/cpanel .

Once you accessed your CPanel we will be moving to upload our files on CPanel Account .
To upload click on **File Manager** and Go to **Public_html** folder and create desired folder.

Suppose you want to add your software at **example.com/url** then create a folder **url** inside your **public_html** folder.

Now upload the .zip file we downloaded from above link. Now we have to extract that file. After extraction, you will get a folder with the same name as our zip file name. Now we can securely delete that zip file. Now move the content from our **EasyURLs-master .** folder to our **link** folder. 

that's it. we completed our first task to upload required files to the server.

## Database Part

### Creating Database

To create database click on **MySQL Databases**. see image below. option 1 to be selected.
