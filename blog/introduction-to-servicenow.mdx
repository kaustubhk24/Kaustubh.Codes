ServiceNow is a cloud-based software company that provides enterprise IT service management (ITSM) solutions. The company's platform allows organizations to automate their IT processes and workflows, manage incidents and service requests, and provide a single source of truth for IT operations. The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive introduction to ServiceNow, including its history, platform, modules, applications, integrations, and benefits.

History

ServiceNow was founded in 2004 by Fred Luddy, a former CTO of Peregrine Systems. Luddy wanted to create a cloud-based platform that could simplify and automate IT service management processes, replacing the outdated and cumbersome software that was commonly used at the time. Luddy's vision was to create a platform that would allow IT teams to work more efficiently and effectively, while also providing better visibility and control over their operations.

ServiceNow initially focused on providing ITSM solutions, but has since expanded its platform to include ITOM, ITBM, and CSM modules and applications. The company went public in 2012 and has since grown rapidly, with a market capitalization of over $100 billion as of 2021.

Platform

The ServiceNow platform is built on a proprietary framework called the ServiceNow Platform, which uses a single data model to store all information related to an organization's IT services. This allows for easy integration between different modules and applications within the platform, as well as with external systems.

The platform is designed to be highly customizable and flexible, with a range of configuration options available to meet the specific needs of different organizations. The platform also includes a range of tools for building custom applications and workflows, allowing organizations to extend the platform beyond the out-of-the-box modules and applications.
