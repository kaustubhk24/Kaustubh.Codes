Private Sub Command1_Click()  
	age = Text2.Text  
	vname = Text1.Text  
	  
	If Val(Text2.Text) < 18 Then  
		MsgBox ("Age should be greater than 18")  
	ElseIf Text3.Text <> "Indian" Then  
		MsgBox ("Nationality must be Indian")  
	Else  
		Form2.Show  
  
		Form2.Label4.Caption = vname  
		Form2.Label5.Caption = age  
	End If  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub Text1_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)  
  
	Select Case Chr(KeyAscii)  
	Case "a" To "z"  
		MsgBox ("Only Capital letters are allowed")  
		KeyAscii = 0  
	Case 0 To 9
