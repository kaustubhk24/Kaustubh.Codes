> **Important** : Please note that this is completely free and open source API, hence anyone can use this API, But if you are using this for Production, Please fork and Turn on GitHub pages for your repository and use that for production purpose, Because due overload it may not repsond some times.

Free Bank IFSC API, If you are making app that is using IFSC code as input, then you must show bank details after user enter's their details, So user can verify it, To do this you will need data of banks and it's not easy to maintain data of around 3 Lakh bank branches in our country and there is no standard api yet provided by RBI ( Reserve Bank of India ) to do this,

There are some api's but they are paid, So you have to pay per request, they charge you because they also have to pay for their hosting's , servers & maintenance etc.

After searching for API's for indian banks we found one GitHub repository, which offers free banking API, You don't have to pay anything for using this,as it is open source you can always use this api without any worry, So In this tutorial we will guide you from beginning to end how to use this api.
